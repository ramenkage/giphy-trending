# giphy-trending

This Ember app displays the top 50 trending GIFs from GIPHY. It was designed with a nod to the [Hypercontext.com](https://hypercontext.com/) design philosophy for... some reason.

## Demo

This app is up and running at [ramenkage-giphy-trending.netlify.app](https://ramenkage-giphy-trending.netlify.app/)

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)

* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd giphy-trending`
* `npm install`

Add your GIPHY API key to the GIPHY_KEY environment variable before running the app. If you don't have a key, you can sign up for a free account at [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide) to obtain one.

Alternatively, you can add the key via dotenv. Create a file named `.env` in the `giphy-trending` directory with the following contents:

    GIPHY_KEY=<api-key>

(Replace `<api-key>` with your key, and don't include the `<>`.)
